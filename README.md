# âš½ ACL Injury Analysis in Female Football Players



This project investigates the biomechanical causes behind the increased risk of non-contact ACL injuries in female football players. Using motion analysis tools â€” Kinovea for video-based tracking and OpenSim for musculoskeletal modeling â€” we compared joint behavior during high-risk movements (jumping, pivoting, and decelerating) between male and female players. Our goal was to identify movement patterns and physiological factors contributing to the heightened injury risk in women.

## Motivation

ACL injuries are 2â€“8 times more common in female athletes than in males. This project, completed as part of the SBEG 106: Introduction to Biomechanics course, seeks to:
- Analyze biomechanical differences between genders during athletic movement
- Explore hormonal and equipment-related factors affecting injury risk
- Suggest preventive strategies tailored to female biomechanics

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection
- Recruited both male and female participants
- Captured videos of three movements: landing, pivoting, and stopping
- Placed visual markers on lower limbs for joint tracking

### 2. Motion Analysis
- Used Kinovea to extract joint angles (knee, hip, ankle) over time
- Imported data into OpenSim to simulate muscle and ligament forces

### 3. Comparative Analysis
- Examined trends in knee valgus, joint flexion, and postural alignment
- Compared force-angle profiles to assess ACL loading

## Results Summary

- Landing: Female players showed greater knee valgus and less knee flexion, increasing ACL tension.
- Pivoting: Females tended to maintain a more flexed knee, raising risk during rotational loads.
- Stopping: A more upright trunk posture was observed in females, reducing muscle engagement and increasing ligament stress.

## Key Insights

- Hormonal changes (e.g., estrogen peaks) may cause ligament laxity
- Standard football cleats are not optimized for female anatomy, reducing stability
- Movement pattern differences suggest a need for female-specific training and equipment
